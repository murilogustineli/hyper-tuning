## Project Setup Guide

To ensure our project runs seamlessly, we'll set up a dedicated Python environment and install the necessary packages.
### Prerequisites

- Python (we're using Python 3 for this project)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Either `virtualenv` or `conda` (based on your preference)

### Setup Instructions
#### 1. Setting up a virtual environment

##### Using Conda:
First, [install Anaconda or Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) based on your operating system.

Then, create a new environment:

```
conda create --name myenv python=3.8
```

Activate the environment:

```
conda activate myenv
```

##### Using virtualenv:
You can skip this step if you already have conda installed and did the previous step.
###### Windows:
```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv
.\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

###### Mac & Linux:
```
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Installing the required packages

There is a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary packages for this project.

If you're using Conda, while most of the packages are available directly through pip, some might have better support or performance when installed through Conda channels:

```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

Otherwise, install the packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### That's it!

Your environment is now set up with all the necessary packages. You can proceed with running or developing the project.
